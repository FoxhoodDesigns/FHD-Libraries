# !!!----------DEPRECATED----------!!!
This Repository and the libraries within are no longer in use.
The eventual shutdown of Eagle by Autodesk due 2026 necessitated migration to KiCad. Which is superior to it anyway.
Please go there for current up-to-date files. This repository will be deleted once migration is complete.
